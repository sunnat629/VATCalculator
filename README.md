# VAT Calculator
With the given API of [jsonvat](https://jsonvat.com/)  , I got an API of VAT converting in various tax tips. In this app, I have developed an app which calculates the currency based on the given country list. You can select any country from the dropdown list. I tried to develop this app with a combination of all the Android Architecture Components and latest technologies.
